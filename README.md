# UdacityDS_Project1

## Installation
The code in this project was written in a Jupyter notebook and is saved as an .ipynb file. Jupyter with Python 3 will be require to run the code.

## Project Description
This project explores a 2017 StackOverflow survey to understand the following:

1. What types of companies employed the largest percentage of full-time remote workers in 2017?
2. How much on-the-job coding experience did you need to land a full-time remote job in 2017?
3. How did the job satisfaction of remote workers compare to their on-site peers?

## File Descriptions
There are several files located in this repository:

Data_Exploration.ipynb - this is the main code file that executes data exploration and creates visualizations

survey_results_public.csv - this is the main data source for the project, consisting of 2017 StackOverflow survey responses

survey_results_schema.csv - this file contains more information about the 2017 StackOverflow survey questions
